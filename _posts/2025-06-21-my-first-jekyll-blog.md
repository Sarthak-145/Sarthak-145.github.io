## Why I Started Writing Blogs as a Developer 🧑‍💻

I wanted a space where I could share my *real* life as a developer — no sugarcoating, no filters. Just raw experiences.

You've probably seen those social media accounts where everyone shares their personal wins and aesthetics. I tried that too. But after a while, I realized it wasn’t what I truly wanted.

As a developer, I follow a lot of devs online. Most of them post:

- 🚀 Their latest project updates
- 🧩 Some clever new feature they built
- 🎯 “Productivity hacks” or tools that made life easier
- 🎧 Reels of them coding with chill music, looking like they’re always in the zone

At one point, I genuinely wondered:

> *Why doesn’t it feel that fun or smooth for me?*

I was building stuff too, doing the same things. But it wasn’t always a vibe. It wasn’t aesthetic. It wasn’t even enjoyable all the time.

Eventually, I realized:  
**It’s content.** And that's okay. They’re not faking it — they’re just showing the good parts.

Do I blame them?  
**Not at all.** In fact, I think they’re doing a great job of making development look exciting and creative.

But here’s the thing no one says out loud:

> ❌ They’re not showing the hard parts  
> ❌ The long nights  
> ❌ The bugs that break your spirit  
> ❌ The burnout  
> ❌ The doubt

And when you don’t see *those*, it creates a false picture.

It messed with me for a while.  
I spent 2–3 months wondering if I should give up.  
I even started looking into other career paths.

But during that time, I kept showing up.  
I kept doing the boring stuff — fixing one small issue at a time. And eventually, I realized:

> 💡 *This* is the real journey.  
> The struggle is part of it. The confusion is part of it.  
> And the moment you solve something that’s been bugging you for hours?  
> That quiet satisfaction — that’s the magic.

## So... why write blogs? ✍️

- To track my journey — honestly
- To vent and reflect
- To remember how far I’ve come
- And maybe... to help someone else who feels the same

Not to teach.  
Not to be an influencer.  
Just to be **real**.

If you're reading this and feel overwhelmed by all the “perfect” dev content out there — you're not alone.

I’ll be here, sharing my ups and downs.

📓 No filters. No fake wins. Just the process.
